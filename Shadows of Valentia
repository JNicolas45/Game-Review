I rate this game a 4/5 stars,  

## Summary
You get to recruit and command a vast variety of chracters who're under command of Alm and Celica, your army varies depening on which main character you play as in the game though to end it all you get to play with everyone on the final level. You play as Alm and Celica, 2 childhood heroes born for greatness.
