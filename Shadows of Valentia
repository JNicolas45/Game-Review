# Game Review for (Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows Of Valentia)

## Details
A remastered up to date version of Fire Emblem Shadows of Valentia, single player.

### Game Title
Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows Of Valentia, you can find the game on e-bay, Gamestops or anywhere that sells 3DS games or the nintendo E-Shop along with additional DLC content. 

### Rating
I rate this game 4/5 stars because one particular DLC is questionable and should've been in the game instead beyind a paywall. 

## Summary
You play as Alm & Celica, childhood friends and bearers of the "Marks" on their hands. Travel around Valentia discovering the true meaning of the Marks while also playing seperately as Alm or Celica and recruiting others to aid you in your cause. For Alm you lead the Deliverance trying to fight back the Regelian Empire from seizing all of Valentia from nefarious figures while recruiting members as you travel, meanwhile as Celica you try to solve the Rigelian Empire and the Zofian Empire war in a "peaceful" way while also trying to meet up with Alm and Co. After defeating Emperor Rudulph the Tyrant King of the Rigelian empire you learn he is Alm's father and this was all a test to see if he was worthy of saving Valentia on his dying breath you learn you must take down The God Duma and his followers as they are in need of a mercy killing due to being beyond corrupted. Eventually you finally meet up with Celica and you two venture into Fear Mountain to face Duma and his cult. Eventually after learning the truth of your "Marks" from the Goddest Mila she grants you the fabled Falchion to slay Lord Duma. After eventually defeating Duma, Alm and Celica reunite the one true Kingdom of Valentia and are the respected King and Queen of said kingdom. Later Generations rememeber them as wise rulers as for Celica she is the Earth Mother, Mila, reborn.

## Final Thoughts
Overall while a remaster of Echoes with changes here and there its still a fantastic game even with several new mechanics such as Mila's Turn Wheel which basically reverts your last action to try another action again though it has limited uses or the sense of realism such as the "Food mechanic" where after every action your unit's mood goes down IF it goes down to unhappy your unit will suffer a significant negative stat change that will keep affecting your unit until you give them food of the sorts. Legendary or Exotic foods give permanant stat bonuses. While i do LOVE the game the reason behind my rating of 4/5 is the DLC content as mentioned above. Said content gives you an extra story perspective, gold, equipment and EXP farming maps but what i don't like is the "Overclass DLC". You have to pay for something that should've been in the game for free, this "Overclass DLC" allows you to reach the final class upgrade for a unit of their respective class which contains a new look, extra stat bonuses and a new skill to boot. The only DLC acceptable is the CIPHER DLC which takes characters from the FIRE EMBLEM CIPHER card game and implements them in the world of Valentia. Still, the other frustrating thing in the game is Magic, i understand everyone except for mages have exceptionally low magic resistance but getting put into critical condition because a maged slapped you with a skill is absurd unless of course you have Myrmidons who takes significantly less damage from magic attacks and is a straight up counter to mages as they are highly resistant to magic damage. Overall Shadows of Valentia offers really good voice acting, interresting chracters, amazing story, amazing mechanics, theres not a single dull moment. What's amazing is the endgame content, which is going down an Archanian dungeon, collecting more loot and discovering the origins of The Fell Dragon Grima. Canonically Fire Emblem Awakening takes place centuries after Fire Emblem Shadows of Valentia whose final foe in that game is The Fell Dragon Grima, perhaps you were one of the exalts to seal Grima as said throughout legend? The fight is grueling and will test you mettle but the reward is worth it. Overall a very fun game one that i'd highly recommend.
